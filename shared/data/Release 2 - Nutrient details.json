(2002), Nichols, Virtue et al. (1998), Nichols, Mooney et al. (1998), Nichols et al. (2002) and, where otherwise unavailable, FSANZ. The factor selected is determined by a consideration of the major fat source in the food. For example, in pastry made with wheat flour and butter, almost all fat will come from added butter rather than from the wheat flour and therefore the fat factor for butter would be used.\n\nInformation on the conversion factors (or fat factors) used for each food is provided as part of the food file.\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids include all cis-isomers of these acids (including omega-3 and omega-6 forms). With the analyses undertaken to date, it is not possible to quantify levels of fatty acids present at less than 0.1% of total fatty acids. In some of the older analyses used in this database, there may be misidentification of some long chain polyunsaturates. \n\nMore recent samples have also been analysed for trans fatty acids (TFA). Due to the vast number of individual TFAs, this database reports the sum total of all analysed TFAs.
